## Project Objective

A personal website designed to showcase programming skills and project experiences. The site features a simplified and responsive design with a main page demonstrating key information of self introduction, programming skills, hobbies and a dedicated page to list project experiences.

The **creative** part that differenciate this homepage is that whenever a user hovers over or clicks on my profile picture, it will change from smiling to laughing and from a laughing one to a smiling one. And I realized this part using vanilla JavaScript to change the profile pictures when it is hovered over or clicked on.

## Features

- Responsive layout using Bootstrap 5
- Simplified design with navigation, main content part and footer
- Project portfolio page
